# Running the project
- Navigate to the folder where you want to place the project and clone the repository in that location by using the command: <br>
``` git clone <repo-link> ```

- Open the folder in a code editor and if you have python installed, create a `Virtual Environment` by the following command: <br>

  ``` python -m venv <environment-name> ```

- After you can see that the environment is created, activate the environment in the cmd: <br>
    ``` <environment-name>\Scripts\activate ```

- Once you can see that the environment is activated in the command line or terminal then install all the requirements from the requirements file:

    ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` <br>
This will take some time to install all necessary packages and modules using pip.

- Once the installation is done then you can go ahead and run the main python file using: <br>
    ``` python main.py ```
